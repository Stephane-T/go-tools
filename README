This repo contains my pathetic attempt to learn GO. I learnt just enough to not like GO.

Some of this code is still live today. Does it still compile ? 

pid.go is used to ensure that you don't run the same software twice.

log.go receives and write in a log file whatever it receives in stdin.

notif_to_redis.go should not be useful to anybody, but feel free to
consult as sample of working concurrent processing of files and
interaction with Redis.

smpp.go basic squeleton of a SMPP server, for the time being, this
server does nothing but accept authentication, enquire_link and
submit_sm.
